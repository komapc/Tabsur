# PR Creation Rule

When I say "make PR", I mean create an actual Pull Request, not just push a branch.

## PR Creation Workflow:
1. **Create Branch**: Always work on feature/fix branches, never directly on master/main
2. **Make Changes**: Implement the requested features or fixes
3. **Commit Frequently**: Make commits after every change (see commit-after-fixes rule)
4. **Push Branch**: Push the branch to origin
5. **Create PR**: Go to GitHub/GitLab and create an actual Pull Request
6. **Link PR**: Share the PR URL for review

## Never Just Push:
- Don't just push a branch when asked to "make PR"
- Don't assume pushing equals creating a PR
- Always create the actual Pull Request interface

## Example Response:
When asked to "make PR":
- ✅ "I'll create a PR for this feature. Let me push the branch and create the PR..."
- ❌ "I'll push the changes to the branch" (without mentioning PR creation)

**Remember**: "make PR" = create Pull Request, not just push branch!
