# Code Quality Standards

Maintain high code quality standards across the Tabsur project:

## Code Style & Formatting:
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JS/JSX)
- Follow ESLint rules and fix warnings
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (max 20-30 lines)
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## React Best Practices:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Avoid prop drilling - use context or state management
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
- Keep components focused on single responsibility

## Error Handling:
- Always handle async operations with try-catch
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use error boundaries for React components
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Performance:
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

## Security:
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate data on both client and server
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
