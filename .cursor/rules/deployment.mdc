# Deployment Rule

When I say "deploy", always deploy both release and debug Docker containers.

## Deployment Workflow:
1. **Debug Deployment**: Deploy debug version first for testing
2. **Release Deployment**: Deploy production release version
3. **Both Environments**: Ensure both are running and accessible

## Commands to Run:
- `./deploy.sh` - Deploys debug environment
- `./fast-ecr-deploy.sh` - Deploys production release to ECR

## Never Deploy Just One:
- Don't deploy only debug when asked to "deploy"
- Don't deploy only release when asked to "deploy"
- Always deploy both environments

## Example Response:
When asked to "deploy":
- ✅ "I'll deploy both debug and release versions. Starting with debug..."
- ❌ "I'll deploy the debug version" (without mentioning release)

**Remember**: "deploy" = both debug AND release, not just one!
