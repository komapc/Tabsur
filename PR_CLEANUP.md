### Unused Scripts & Files
- `install.sh` - MERN stack installation script
- `docker-compose.release.yml` - Old release configuration  
- `Dockerfile.client.optimized` & `Dockerfile.server.optimized` - Replaced by multi-stage builds
- `docker-compose.ecr.optimized.yml` - Optimized ECR compose (replaced by current)
- `nginx.conf` - Root-level nginx config (moved to docker/ directory)
- `tabsur-deploy.tar.gz` - Large deployment archive (180MB)
- `test-new-db.js` & `test0.1_12_5_20` - Temporary test files

### Outdated Documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Replaced by updated DEPLOYMENT.md
- `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Replaced by FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` - Old PR documentation
- `PR_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Migration completion notes
- `SELF_MANAGED_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Self-managed setup notes
- `COST_ANALYSIS_SELF_MANAGED.md` - Cost analysis (outdated)

### Migration Scripts
- `migrate-to-self-managed.sh` - Self-managed migration script
- `migrate-to-eu-west-1.sh` - EU migration script
- `complete-migration.sh` - Migration completion script
- `check-migration-status.sh` - Migration status checker

## üîß What Was Updated

### Core Configuration
- **package.json**: Updated name from "BeMyGuest" to "tabsur", version 2.0.0
- **.dockerignore**: Removed MERN references
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite to reflect current project state

### Documentation
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Updated to reflect current architecture
- **FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: Updated to reflect ECR deployment
- **All script files**: Updated project name references
- **API docs**: Updated project name and contact information
- **Frontend**: Updated app metadata and component text

### CI/CD Configuration
- **GitHub Actions**: Removed Redis service references
- **CI documentation**: Removed Redis references

## üö´ Components Removed

### Redis
- Removed from all Docker Compose files
- Removed from CI/CD workflows  
- Removed from deployment documentation
- Updated references to indicate "Not used"

### MERN Stack
- Removed MERN installation script
- Removed MERN directory references from .dockerignore
- Updated documentation to reflect current tech stack

### Old Docker Configurations
- Removed old single-stage Dockerfiles
- Removed optimized Docker configurations
- Kept only multi-stage Dockerfiles for production/debug

## ‚úÖ Current State After Cleanup

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Deployment**: AWS ECR + EC2
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx
- **Authentication**: JWT

### Architecture
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- ECR-based container management
- Nginx load balancing with CORS handling
- JWT-based authentication
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Reduced Confusion** - Clear, current documentation
2. **Smaller Repository** - Removed unused files and scripts
3. **Better Maintainability** - Focused on current architecture
4. **Consistent Naming** - All references use "Tabsur"
5. **Modern Stack** - Removed outdated technologies (Redis, MERN)
6. **Optimized Builds** - Multi-stage Docker builds only

## üß™ Testing

- [x] All project name references updated to "Tabsur"
- [x] No Redis references remain
- [x] No MERN stack references remain  
- [x] Documentation reflects current architecture
- [x] Application builds and runs correctly

## üìã Files Changed

- **Deleted**: 20+ unused files and scripts
- **Updated**: 15+ documentation and configuration files
- **Renamed**: Project from "BeMyGuest" to "Tabsur"
- **Consolidated**: Multiple deployment guides into focused documentation

## üîç Impact

- **Repository Size**: Reduced by ~200MB
- **Documentation**: Consolidated and updated
- **Maintenance**: Easier to understand and maintain
- **Deployment**: Clear, current deployment process
- **Development**: Streamlined local development setup
