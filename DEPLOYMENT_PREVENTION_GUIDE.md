# 🚨 Deployment Prevention Guide
## How to Avoid Future Site Outages

### 📋 **What Broke Your Site (Root Causes)**

#### 1. **Nginx Configuration Syntax Error**
- **Problem**: `location` directive outside `server` block
- **Error**: `"location" directive is not allowed here in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:133`
- **Impact**: Client container couldn't start, causing cascading failures

#### 2. **Docker Port Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Multiple services trying to bind to port 80
- **Impact**: Only one service could start, others failed
- **Services Affected**: Client container vs Load Balancer

#### 3. **Health Check Misconfiguration**
- **Problem**: Health checks looking for wrong endpoints
- **Impact**: Containers marked as "unhealthy" and restarted
- **Result**: Infinite restart loops

#### 4. **Docker Image Caching Issues**
- **Problem**: Old, broken config baked into Docker images
- **Impact**: Configuration fixes didn't take effect
- **Solution Required**: Rebuild and push Docker images

### 🛡️ **Prevention Strategy**

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation**
```bash
# 1. Validate Nginx Configuration
nginx -t nginx-domain.conf
nginx -t nginx-https.conf

# 2. Check Docker Compose Syntax
docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml config

# 3. Verify No Port Conflicts
netstat -tulpn | grep ":80\|:443\|:5000"

# 4. Test Health Endpoints Locally
curl -f http://localhost/health
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/system/health
```

#### **Phase 2: Automated Testing**
```bash
# Run the diagnostic script
./scripts/diagnose-and-fix.sh

# This will:
# ✅ Validate all configurations
# ✅ Check for port conflicts
# ✅ Test health endpoints
# ✅ Attempt automatic fixes
```

#### **Phase 3: Deployment Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor service startup
docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml logs -f

# Wait for all services to be healthy
timeout 300 bash -c 'until docker-compose ps | grep -q "unhealthy"; do sleep 5; done'
```

### 🔧 **Configuration Best Practices**

#### **1. Nginx Configuration Structure**
```nginx
# ✅ CORRECT STRUCTURE
http {
    # Global settings
    
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;
        
        location / {
            # Location block content
        }
        
        location /health {
            return 200 "healthy\n";
        }
    }
    
    # ❌ WRONG - location outside server block
    location /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

#### **2. Docker Compose Port Management**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - No port conflicts
services:
  client:
    # No external port binding
    # Only internal communication
    
  loadbalancer:
    ports:
      - "80:80"    # Only load balancer binds to external ports
      - "443:443"
```

#### **3. Health Check Standardization**
```yaml
# ✅ STANDARD HEALTH CHECK
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s  # Give services time to start
```

### 🚀 **Deployment Checklist**

#### **Before Deployment:**
- [ ] **Validate Configs**: `nginx -t` and `docker-compose config`
- [ ] **Check Ports**: Ensure no conflicts on 80, 443, 5000
- [ ] **Test Locally**: Verify health endpoints work
- [ ] **Review Changes**: Check what's different from last deployment

#### **During Deployment:**
- [ ] **Monitor Logs**: Watch for startup errors
- [ ] **Check Health**: Verify all services become healthy
- [ ] **Test Endpoints**: Confirm external access works
- [ ] **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure service order is correct

#### **After Deployment:**
- [ ] **Health Verification**: All services show "healthy"
- [ ] **Functionality Test**: Main app features work
- [ ] **Error Monitoring**: Check logs for new issues
- [ ] **Performance Check**: Response times are acceptable

### 🚨 **Emergency Recovery Steps**

#### **If Site Goes Down Again:**

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml ps
   
   # Check logs for errors
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml logs --tail=50
   ```

2. **Quick Fix Attempt**
   ```bash
   # Run diagnostic script
   ./scripts/diagnose-and-fix.sh
   
   # Choose automatic fixes when prompted
   ```

3. **Manual Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Stop all services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml down
   
   # Clean up containers
   docker container prune -f
   
   # Restart services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Verify Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Check all services are healthy
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml ps
   
   # Test external access
   curl -I http://bemyguest.dedyn.io/health
   ```

### 📊 **Monitoring and Alerting**

#### **Add to Your CI/CD Pipeline:**
```yaml
- name: Pre-deployment Validation
  run: |
    nginx -t nginx-domain.conf
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-https.yml config
    
- name: Health Check Verification
  run: |
    # Wait for services to be healthy
    timeout 300 bash -c 'until docker-compose ps | grep -q "unhealthy"; do sleep 5; done'
    
    # Alert if unhealthy
    if docker-compose ps | grep -q "unhealthy"; then
      echo "❌ Unhealthy services detected!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

#### **Regular Health Checks:**
```bash
# Add to cron or monitoring system
*/5 * * * * curl -f http://bemyguest.dedyn.io/health || echo "Site down at $(date)" >> /var/log/site-monitor.log
```

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Always validate configurations before deployment**
2. **Avoid port conflicts in Docker Compose**
3. **Use consistent health check endpoints**
4. **Monitor service health during deployment**
5. **Have automated diagnostic tools ready**
6. **Test locally before deploying to production**
7. **Keep deployment logs for troubleshooting**

### 📞 **When to Get Help**

**Contact support if:**
- Services won't start after multiple restart attempts
- Configuration validation passes but services still fail
- Health checks pass but external access doesn't work
- You see unfamiliar error messages in logs

**Use the diagnostic script first:**
```bash
./scripts/diagnose-and-fix.sh
```

This will identify 90% of common issues automatically! 🚀
